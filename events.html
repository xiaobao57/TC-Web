		<p> Our helping hand comes both in the form of physical resources (such as cash cards and blankets) and, very importantly, emotional support. Ultimately, we want to give these individuals and their families the ability to stand back up and recover from the devastation of this disaster. From participating in distributions in the past, it has always been most touching to me to see the emotions that flow, both from us as the givers and from the disaster victims as receivers, as they share their stories with us and as we offer them our support. </p>

		<p> Now it's time for you to soar to chase your goals and make the best out of you. You will do it bearing our loves and expectations.

		We expect you to be brave because now you know you have a big and strong heart, and you are not alone.
		We expect you, wherever you will be, to touch the hearts of people around you the way you did in TCCA.
		we expect you to remember you have an extended family here in Austin that loved you and will continue to care about you.

		Best wishes, my children.
